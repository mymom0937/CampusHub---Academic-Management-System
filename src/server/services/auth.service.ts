/**
 * Auth service - delegates to Better-Auth
 *
 * Better-Auth handles all authentication logic:
 * - Password hashing & verification
 * - Session management
 * - Cookie handling (via tanstackStartCookies plugin)
 *
 * Server-side auth operations use auth.api methods in auth.actions.ts.
 * This file is kept for any custom auth-adjacent business logic.
